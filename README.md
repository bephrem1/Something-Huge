# Something-Huge
__________________________________________
This will be a huge project that will deliver business value someday. </br>
**School Year:** Freshman @ University of Maryland (class of 2021) </br>
**Note:** I will update this repo when an idea hits me and planning begins
__________________________________________

I've been programming for a while I think that it's time do a HUGE project myself (or with a team I build along the way). </br></br>
<b>My motivation for projects until now has been sort of like this:</b> </br>
#1) I make a project just for the heck of seeing if I can make it or not (For Example My Project I Did In 3 Weeks [OutfitHash](https://github.com/bephrem1/OutfitHash-Public)) Then I Think..."Where From Here"</br>
#2) I want to see how many different tools I can use in a project to be exposed to more stacks and development workflows</br>
#3) I want to make something "Impressive" or "Creative" and force what should be an organic process of letting ideas take shape </br>
</br>
<b>I have an intuition for what my next self-started project should be...something HUGE:</b>
- Something someone sees and says..."That's awesome, I want to use that." and they do and keep coming back </br>
- Something that delivers business value and takes months of intense development </br>
- Something that requires real engineering and problem solving rather than being simple programming using others abstractions </br>
- Something that someone sees and then looks at me/the team and is like..."You made that that?" </br>
- Something I can point at and say "That's the best I can do, that is my best...that is the culmination of years of self learning and study. I'm proud of that." </br>
</br>
<b>This project will: </b>
- Be healivy modular and avoid tight coupling that I had seen be a problem in many of my past projects especially with past projects using asynchronous operations that rely on one another (the solution to keep loose coupling and maintain decent abstraction at least in JS would be to have a Promise factory module that served up segmented promises that combine to form the larger operation in a cascade of execution </br>
- Be scalable. Past projects of mine have been short sighted and designed in a way that would make them hard to scale if that choice was made. Scalable software is software that is modular, abstracted, and where units have a single responsibility passing their results/products to other units to build up to the ultimate final solution/result.</br>
I see this project as being my official time of leaving the programming sandbox I've been in for years and entering the realm of real problem solving (database to business logic to UX) and true engineering of scalable solutions. </br>
</br>
This could be a web app, a bot, a whole software suite spanning web and mobile,...it's just got to be big and I subliminally feel it is going to happen. That's why I made this repo to keep this at the top of my mind. Coming Soon. </br>
